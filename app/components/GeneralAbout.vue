      About the project
    </h1>
    <p>
      Developing a minimalist world map that displays information about
      countries, capitals, and average temperatures when hovered over or clicked
      on is a project close to my heart. My goal is to gain clarity and profound
      insights through radical reduction using just a few elements. It is a
      personal work that expresses curiosity, humility, and a genuine connection
      to the idea. The timeline allows temperature trends to be compared, making
      it possible to experience how much the climate has changed in a short
      period of time.

      Using visualizations to create a clear, calm approach to the big questions
      of our time, without pointing the moral finger. Protecting our environment
      is something that concerns us all, but placing the burden solely on
      individuals often provokes resistanceâ€”which is understandable when
      everyday life is already dominated by more pressing concerns. That is why
      responsibility is needed above all where structures are created: among
      groups of people with real social influence, whose decisions improve or
      worsen the balance of this world.

      Hopefully, this relatively simple data visualization will not only serve
      as a playful introduction to global differences, but also send a clear
      signal about the urgency of global warming.
