      My Motivation & Coding Journey
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
      I am used to work with React, so this project was a great way to get to
      know Vue & Nuxt better. And I have to say that I really love it. It is
      super intuitive & its structure fosters simplicity. Everything feels
      coherent. More coherent than React & Next I have to say. So I guess from
      now on React & Next are not my first choice anymore.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
      My biggest challenges during this project was the SVG map dependency and
      how to use topojson/geojson propeply. It is a great dependency and overall
      I am super thankfull and glad that everybody can use Open-Source Data in
      projects, but I took me a while to understand everything and still there
      are some issues I don't know how to fix yet. Additonally I had to "cheat"
      a little with TypeScript and I'm still not quite sure if types were
      actually the problem. Additionally I had problems with some dependencies
      and their compabilities, especially Eslint - what made me decide not to
      install it (which of course made me more clean up work than necessary).
      All in all I was focused to the bigger picture, which was for me in this
      case to show you an interactive UI with meaningful but minimalistic
      content and overall was a great learning & coding journey to me.

      Unfortunately the visualization of the content isn't too strikening as I
      was expecting while working with data which have the potenzial to show our
      global warming crisis (compared to what I wrote in the About Section ;P ).
      But nevertheless I am really motivated to do something out of my passion
      for code and combine it with my core values. That's why I can genuinly
      say, that your main technical product is outstanding: it gives everyone
      the opportunity to do something for good without having barriers. There
      are a lot of reasons why people can't always chose to do something for
      their environment there live in - next to structual problems in society I
      am not a big fan of moralize individuals. So for me your search engine is
      a perfect example how a technical tool can empower people to engage in
      sustainable projects without excluding people or jugde.

      I would be really very proud to contribute to such a great misson.
